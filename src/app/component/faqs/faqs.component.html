              <h2>What is Annadaat?</h2>

                </p>

              <h2>How does Annadaat work?</h2>
              <p> It's easy to place an order on Annadaat. Simply browse our catering partners, view their menu and pick your order. You can pay online or by invoice if you have a Corporate Account with us. Once we receive your order, we pass on all the details to the caterer and liaise with them to make sure your order goes off without a hitch.
                </p>

              <h2>Is the food delivered? Can I pick it up?</h2>
              <p>Its totally up to you. But it really doesn't matter because we have free delivery on all our orders.
                </p>

              <h2>Does Annadaat mark up the caterer’s prices?</h2>
              <p>No. You will pay the same price as when ordering at the caterer directly. There will be no extra charge for ordering through CaterSpot. 
                </p>

                </p>     
              <p>Then Receive quotations from our hand-picked caterers. There are no mark ups. And the quotations come with a best-price guarantee.
                </p>      
              <p>Finally select the quotation you like best and your Representative will help you place the order and answer any questions along the way.
                </p>

              <h2> Can I change an order once it is placed?</h2>
              <p> We understand plans change. In the case you need to adjust your order, contact our support team by email. Our catering partners need advance notice to prepare additional menu items, so try to make these changes as soon as possible.
                </p>

              <h2>Is there a fee for cancelling an order?</h2>
              <p>There is no cancellation fee, but the caterer may have to charge for food already prepared. </p>
